## **🟩 Problem 3 – Messy React (Refactor Task)**

Given a deliberately messy React + TypeScript code snippet, the task was to:

1. Identify anti-patterns  
2. Fix computational inefficiencies  
3. Provide a clean refactored version  
4. Explain the reasoning  

### 🔹 Skills Involved
- React hooks (useMemo, mapping, sorting)
- TypeScript interfaces
- Cleanup of logic, conditions, memoization
- Removing unnecessary computations and bugs
- Improving readability and correctness

### 📂 Location  
`src/problem3/`

Files include:
